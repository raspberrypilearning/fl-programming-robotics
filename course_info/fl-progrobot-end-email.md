We are very happy to welcome you to our community of educators and volunteers. From Australia to Zimbabwe, we all share the mission to give everyone the chance to learn about computing and technology. Thanks for being part of this course.

The following courses may help to develop your background knowledge and inspire further discussion:

+ [Design and Prototype Embedded Computer Systems](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/embedded-systems) explores how you can design a product, looking at both its construction and how it is programmed. Many embedded systems involve components similar to those you worked with in this course.
+ [Object-oriented Programming in Python: Create Your Own Adventure Game](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/object-oriented-principles) goes into more detail about the idea of "classes" - like the `Robot` class that you used in this course.
+ [Understanding Computer Systems](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/computer-systems/) and [How Computers Work: Demystifying Computation](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-computers-work/) provide some background about the history of computers.
