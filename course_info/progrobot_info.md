On this course from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, you'll build a robot buggy controlled by a Raspberry Pi.

You'll start by learning how to connect motors to your Raspberry Pi, and how to write a Python program to control them to move your buggy. As your skills increase, you'll move on to adding sensors to your robot. By writing algorithms that use the inputs from these sensors, you'll give your robot the ability to follow lines and avoid obstacles.

You'll also look at modern robotics, and think about how robotics affects society.


Course syllabus:
Provide a list of short bullet points outlining the key themes that this course covered. This will appear on the Certificate of Achievement transcript and the course description page under the heading “What topics will you cover?” Avoid using verbs and the past tense, and do not mention “learners”. If the list is long, break it up with sub-headings, based on each week’s theme – for example, “Week 1 – Introduction to Cellular Networks and their Planning”.

+ The GPIOzero Python library, and how this can be used to interact with input and output components.
+ The construction of a simple robot buggy.
+ How distance sensors work
+ Obstacle avoidance algorithms
+ Line sensors
+ Line following algorithms
+ The effect of robotics on society

Who is this course for?
Explain the target audience for this course and the experience and knowledge they need to understand it. Avoid general statements such as “This course is open to anyone.” Instead, be specific about who it is for, and name audience groups or job titles.

This course is for people with little or no experience with physical computing, who want to create their first robot. Ideally you should have some basic familiarity with Python, for example from our [Programming 101 course](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/programming-101).

It is particularly well suited for teachers delivering lessons at GCSE level or equivalent, who are looking for engaging programming activities for their lessons.

Course description for certificate: 50-300 characters including spaces. Provide a brief, past-tense description of the course, the subjects it covered and what was involved. This will be shown on the Statement of Participation and/or Certificate of Achievement.

This course involved building a robot buggy based on a Raspberry Pi. It covered the use of GPIOzero to control the motors, and to receive input from line sensors and a UDS sensor. Learners used Python to program their robot to move in particular patterns, avoid obstacles, and follow a line.
