## Build your own robot buggy


New description - Max 600 characters inc spaces:

On this course from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, you'll build a robot buggy controlled by a Raspberry Pi.

You'll learn how to connect motors to your Raspberry Pi, and how to write a Python program to control them to move your buggy. As your skills increase, you'll start to add sensors to your robot. By writing algorithms that use the inputs from these sensors, you'll give your robot the ability to follow lines and avoid obstacles.

You'll also look at modern robotics, and consider the impact of robotics on society.


### Course syllabus:

+ The GPIO Zero Python library, and how this can be used to interact with input and output components
+ The construction of a simple robot buggy
+ How distance sensors work
+ Obstacle avoidance algorithms
+ Line sensors
+ Line following algorithms
+ The effect of robotics on society

### Who is this course for?

This course is for people with little or no experience with physical computing, who want to create their first robot. Ideally you should have some basic familiarity with Python, for example from our [Programming 101 course](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/programming-101).

It is particularly well suited for teachers delivering lessons at GCSE level or equivalent, who are looking for engaging programming activities for their lessons.

What software or tools do you need?

### This course requires you to have the following:

#### Hardware:

+ Raspberry Pi 3B, 3B+, or 4
+ Motor controller board
+ 2 x 3V - 6V DC motors
+ 2 x wheels
+ Ball caster (unless using more than 2 wheels)
+ Ultrasonic distance sensor (between 1 and 2)
+ 2 x line following sensors
+ Jumper leads (female-to-female and male-to-female) or wire
+ AA battery holder (for 4 AA batteries)
+ 4 x AA batteries
+ A USB battery pack (to power the Raspberry Pi)
+ Soldering iron and solder
+ Wire strippers
+ Scissors
+ Screwdriver
+ A small cardboard box for the chassis (can be plastic, wood, metal, etc.)

You can view most of the required components on this [AliExpress wish list](https://my.aliexpress.com/wishlist/shared.htm?groupId=100000018016415), but they can be ordered / bought anywhere, and alternatives are also available.

#### Software:

+ The latest version of the Raspbian operating system
+ An IDE of your choice

#### Additional extras:

+ Adhesives (duct tape / electrical tape, putty, glue, etc.)
+ Cable ties or velcro straps
+ GPIO reference card


### Learning outcomes â€” must start with one of the approved verbs:

+ Describe the advantages of using robotics to teach computer science
+ Produce a robot buggy that can move in particular patterns, avoid obstacles, and follow a line
+ Develop suitable algorithms for your robot depending on the task
+ Demonstrate how to control a variety of components using the GPIO Zero Python library
+ Discuss different uses of robotics and the components that they may use

Course description for certificate: 50-300 characters including spaces:

This course involved building a robot buggy based on a Raspberry Pi. It covered the use of GPIO Zero to control the motors, and to receive input from line sensors and a UDS sensor. Learners used Python to program their robot to move in particular patterns, avoid obstacles, and follow a line.
