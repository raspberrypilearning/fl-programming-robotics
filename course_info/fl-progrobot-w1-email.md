Over the next three weeks, you'll build a robot buggy and program it to allow it to:

+ move autonomously,
+ avoid obstacles,
+ follow a line.

You'll start this week by learning how the Raspberry Pi's General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pins allow you to connect components, and why you need an additional "motor board" to be able to connect motors to the Raspberry Pi. By the end of the week you'll have assembled a wheeled buggy, and programmed it using the programming language Python and the GPIOzero library.
