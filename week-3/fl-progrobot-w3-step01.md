## Welcome to week three

Welcome to week three of *Robotics with Raspberry Pi: Build and Program Your First Robot Buggy*. Last week you added a UDS to your robot, and programmed it to avoid obstacles.

This week you will:

+ Look at how line-sensing robots are used
+ Connect some line sensors to your robot and check that they sense correctly the change between white paper and a dark line
+ Program your robot to follow a line
+ Think about how to improve the performance of your line-following robot

I hope you enjoy the week!
