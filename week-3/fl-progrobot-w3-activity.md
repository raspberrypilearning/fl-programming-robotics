# Week three: Allowing robots to follow lines

## Welcome to week three

Welcome to week three of the course!

## Line-sensing robots

Learn about how line sensors work and their uses in robotics.

## Adding a line sensor to the buggy

Attach two line sensors to your robot buggy and test that they work.
