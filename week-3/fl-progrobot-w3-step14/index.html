<h2 id="the-end-of-the-course">The end of the course</h2>
<p>Congratulations on reaching the end of the course! Over the three weeks of the course, you've built a robot based on a Raspberry Pi, and developed it so that it could move, avoid obstacles, and follow lines. You've also completed an assignment to increase the functionality of your robot.</p>
<p>You've learnt about the GPIO Zero library and used it to control your robot. You've also had to think about how to construct your robot, attaching new elements to the chassis in suitable positions. It's also likely that you've had to fix some problems, either with how you built your robot, or with your programming. Throughout the course you've been developing these skills, which will be applicable to a whole range of products, not just robots. Good luck with all your future projects!</p>
<h3 id="course-feedback">Course feedback</h3>
<p>Share your thoughts on the course in the comments section. We'd love to hear your feedback. We'd particularly like to hear which parts of the course you enjoyed, something new that you learnt, or where you struggled.</p>
<h3 id="continue-learning">Continue learning</h3>
<p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation offers a range of other courses, and if you are a teacher in England, you can get free upgraded access to them through <a href="https://teachcomputing.org/courses?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;level=&amp;location=Online&amp;topic=&amp;certificate=#filter-results&amp;utm_campaign=ncce&amp;utm_content=completion">teachcomputing.org</a>, the official website of the National Centre for Computing Education. This means you'll have free, unlimited access to the course, even after the run finishes, and you'll receive a Certificate of Achievement from FutureLearn when you complete the course. You'll also be able to use the courses as evidence for National Centre for Computing Education certification.</p>
<p>If you are not a teacher in England, you can <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/partners/raspberry-pi">join the other courses from the Raspberry Pi Foundation for free on FutureLearn</a>.</p>
