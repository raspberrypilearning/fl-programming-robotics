## End of the course

Congratulations on reaching the end of the course! Over the three weeks you've built a robot based on a Raspberry Pi, and developed it so that it could move, avoid obstacles, and follow lines. You've also completed an assignment to increase the functionality of your robot.

You've learnt about the gpiozero library, and used it to control your robot. Over the course you've also had to think about how to construct your robot, attaching new elements to the chassis in suitable positions. It's also likely that you've had to fix some problems - whether with how you've built your robot, or with your programming. Throughout the course you've been developing these skills, which will be applicable to a range of products - not just robots! Good luck with all of your future projects.


### Course feedback

Share your thoughts on the course in the comments section. We'd love to hear your feedback. We'd particularly like to hear which parts of the course you enjoyed, something new that you learnt, or where you struggled.

### Continue learning

You can continue learning with [other courses from the Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.futurelearn.com/partners/raspberry-pi). In particular, the following courses may help to develop your background knowledge and inspire further discussion:

+ [Design and Prototype Embedded Computer Systems](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/embedded-systems) explores how you can design a product, looking at both its construction and how it is programmed. Many embedded systems involve components similar to those you worked with in this course.

+ [Object-oriented Programming in Python: Create Your Own Adventure Game](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/object-oriented-principles) goes into more detail about the idea of "classes" - like the `Robot` class that you used in this course.

+ [Understanding Computer Systems](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/computer-systems/) and [How Computers Work: Demystifying Computation](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/how-computers-work/) provide some background about the history of computers.

Lastly, a quick reminder for teachers from England that this course can be used as evidence for your National Centre for Computing Education certificate. Visit the [NCCE website](https://www.teachcomputing.org/?utm_source=futurelearn&utm_medium=course&utm_campaign=ncce&utm_content=completion) for more details.
