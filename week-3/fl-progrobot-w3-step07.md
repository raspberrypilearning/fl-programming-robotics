## Discussion: take a minute to breath

So far, you have made incredible progress with your buggy - turning it from an inanimate object into a robot that is able to sense the world around it!

Take a minute to congratulate yourself on the hard work and persistence you have shown throughout this course - well done!

<!-- DELETE? --> During this week, you have connected 2 line sensors to the robot buggy and tested that each sensor detects the difference between a white surface and a black line. 

If you are have any questions or struggling with anything robot-related, **leave a comment and someone will provide help and support**.

Now is also a perfect time to share your progress and any pictures you have of your robot in action. **Post a link to an image hosting platform such as [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) in the comments below.**
<!-- Would we encourage learners to post videos? If so, would we recommend a video hosting site? -->

Have a think about how you are going to program the buggy to follow a line on a track, which is coming up next. **What do you think the line following algorithm will look like?**
