## Any questions?

So far, you have made incredible progress with your buggy - turning it from an inanimate object into a robot that is able to sense the world around it and act upon this information!

Take a minute to congratulate yourself on the hard work and persistence you have shown throughout this course - well done!

If you are have any questions or are struggling with anything robot-related, **leave a comment below and one of the facilitators will be able to provide help and support**.

This is also a perfect time to share the progress you have made and any pictures that you have of your robot in action. **Post a link to an image hosting platform such as [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) in the comments section.**

### What's next?

In the next step, you are going to write an algorithm for a basic line following robot. 

You already know that the line sensors can detect the difference between light and dark surfaces, and this can be translated into a digital output of 0 (for a white surface) or 1 (for a black surface).

**What do you think the line following algorithm might look like? What should the buggy do when the left or right sensor detects the black line of your track?**
