## Sharing your progress

You have made incredible progress with your robot buggy, turning it from an inanimate object into a robot that is able to sense the world around it and act upon this information.

Well done. Take a minute to congratulate yourself on the hard work and persistence you have shown throughout this course.

This is also a perfect time to share the progress you have made and any pictures or videos that you have of your robot in action. Describe your progress, and share a link to any image or videos you've taken of your robot, in the comments section below. You may need to use an image-hosting platform such as [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) or a video-hosting platform such as [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com).

### Are you stuck with anything?

If you have any questions or are struggling with anything related to your robot buggy, leave a comment below and one of the course facilitators will provide help and support.

### Next steps for your robot

In the next step you are going to write an algorithm for a basic line-following robot.

You already know that the line sensors can detect the difference between light and dark surfaces, and this can be translated into a digital output of 0 (for a white surface) or 1 (for a black surface).

Have a think about the line following algorithm by considering these questions:

+ What do you think the line following algorithm might look like?
+ How should your robot react when the left sensor detects the line of your track?
+ What about when the right sensor detects the line?

**Answer these questions in the comments section, either by writing the different stages of the algorithm as a list of instructions or by creating a flowchart and posting a link to it.**
