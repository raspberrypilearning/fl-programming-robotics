## Designing a more complex algorithm


### Planning a better algorithm

+ Reading the data from the line sensors

+ Using 1s and 0s from the line sensor values to modify the robot movement




### Taking it further

+ Using a line following PID array sensor

+ Reading the proportional value of the robotâ€™s position compared to the line

+ Calculating the derivative value (i.e. rate of change) using the setpoint value and the current value

+ Adjusting the direction based on the derivative

+ Testing and refining the equation and algorithm
