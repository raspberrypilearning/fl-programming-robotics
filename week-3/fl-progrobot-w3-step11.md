## Peer-assessment: create a new function for your robot buggy

This course has been all about building and programming a robot buggy using a Raspberry Pi. Over the previous three weeks, you have been attaching components to your chassis and writing code to communicate with these components. 

Now it's time for you to create a new piece of functionality for your robot, which you can share with another learner and get feedback on. 

Some examples of modifications you could make to your robot are:

+ Allow the buggy to be controlled [remotely](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/remote-control-buggy) 
+ Add a second UDS to the front of your chassis to improve object detection 
+ Replace the ball caster with two more wheels
+ Use a [PID controller](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/robotPID) to gain more precise control over your robot's  movement

For this assignment you should upload images of your robot to a service such as [Imgur](https://www.imgur.com/) or to a video hosting platform such as [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) and include the link in your assignment. 

Alongside this, write a short summary of your new function, including:

+ The original idea and why you chose it
+ The components you used and any modifications you had to make your robot
+ A copy of your code and a description of how you designed and tested your program
+ The challenges and successes you had during the course

This assignment is peer-assessed: once you have submitted your assignment, it will be reviewed by another learner on the course. In turn, you will be asked to assess another learnerâ€™s work.

There is a free-form text box for you to use below, but please feel free to include links to any online content you produce. You could use any cloud-based storage or office solution, such as:

* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com)
* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)

If you do this, paste a link to your assignment in the space below, along with any information you feel might be relevant to your reviewer.

**Warning: Once you submit your assignment, you cannot edit it again. It will be sent to another learner for feedback. Please be sure to read over your submission before you send it off.**

### Assignment guidelines

You must give three assignment guidelines in the form of questions for the peer reviewer to answer in the peer-review step, for example:

+ What new piece of functionality has the author added?
+ How well have they documented the components used and code developed?
+ Has the author tested their program thoroughly?
