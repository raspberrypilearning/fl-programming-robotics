## Testing the line sensors

Next youâ€™re going to attach your line following sensors to the buggy and test whether the sensors are working. You will tune the line sensors a little to ensure they are picking up changes in light between white paper and a black line.

<!-- Taken from AliExpress -->
The Line Tracking Sensor for Arduino can detect the white lines in black background and black lines in white background.
If Line Tracking Sensor detect black color, the signal line (DO) of the sensor is HIGH,  at the same time the LED (blue) on the sensor lights up. If Line Tracking Sensor detect white color, the signal line (DO) goes LOW.

### What you will need

+ White piece of card
+ Black tape
+ Screwdriver

### Preparing your track 

First, you will need to prepare a line for the buggy to follow. I am going to use a white piece of card for the background surface with a black strip of tape for the line so there is a really clear contrast in light levels that the sensor can detect.

### Attaching the sensors to the chassis

Next, you will need to figure out where the line sensors need to be secured to the buggy so they can follow a line effectively.

Before you do this, I recommend taking a photo of your buggy and the connections between the Raspberry Pi, motor controller board, and UDS. It is quite likely that a few of the jumper leads will come loose during this process. Use the photo of the buggy and/or the building the buggy steps in the previous 2 weeks to help you check and reconnect the leads correctly.

Both of the line sensors need to be positioned near the front of the chassis, with one either side of the ball caster. This way, the sensors will be able to detect whether it is directly over the line, to the left of the line, or to the right of the line. 

The sensors should also be fairly close to the center of the buggy, not right on the very left or very right if possible. This is so both sensors are able to detect the black line when the buggy is directly over it and so the buggy can be programmed to move straight forwards at this point.

On the buggy, mark where you want to position the line sensors so that the sensor can view the line beneath it. Cut two small holes in the bottom of your buggy and secure the sensors in place.

<!-- include the range of distance the sensors should be from the surface before affixing it to the chassis -->

The best distance between objects such as ground and the sensor is 1-3 cm.

### Tuning the line sensors

You are now going to check that the line sensors detect the difference between a light surface and a dark line.

With the line sensors attached, boot up your Raspberry Pi. Move the buggy slowly side to side so each of the line sensors passes over the dark line.

Whilst a sensor is over a light surface, the LED on the sensor board should turn off. Conversely, when a sensor passes over a dark line, the LED on the sensor should turn off.

![Video-gif of the LED on each line sensor turning on when the sensor is over the white surface and off when the sensor is over the black line](images/)

<!-- Re-write and further explain the following paragraph -->

Use the small potentiometer on the board to tune your sensors, so that the LEDs turns off when over a dark line, and lights up when over white space.

Once you have tuned the sensors, you can proceed to programming your robot in the next step.
