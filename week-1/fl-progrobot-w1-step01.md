### What you will need

#### Hardware

**Basic buggy**

+ Raspberry Pi 3B, 3B+ or 4
+ Motor controller board 
+ 2 x 3V - 6V DC motors
+ 2 x wheels
+ Ball caster (unless using more than 2 wheels)
+ Ultrasonic distance sensor (between 1-2)
+ 2 x line following sensors
+ Jumper leads (female-female and male-female) or wire
+ AA battery holder (for 4 AA batteries)
+ 4 x AA batteries
+ A USB battery pack (to power the Raspberry Pi)
+ Soldering iron and solder
+ Wire strippers
+ Scissors
+ Screwdriver
+ A small cardboard box for the chassis (can be plastic, wood, metal etc.)

Software:

+ The latest version of the Raspbian operating system

Additional extras:

+ Adhesives (duct tape / electrical tape, putty, glue etc.)
+ Cable ties or velcro straps
+ GPIO reference card

**Using a soldering iron can be a bit daunting at first but whether you are new to soldering or a veteran solderer, this [getting started with soldering](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-soldering) resource will provide you with some quick tips and tricks.**

A Raspberry Pi model 3B or above is recommended as you can connect to it over Wifi or Bluetooth without an adapted which will help when programming the buggy.

The ultrasonic distance sensor and line following sensor are required for week 2 and week 3 respectively. 

A ball caster is necessary if your buggy has only two wheels to act as a third wheel so the buggy is balanced and can move freely.
