### What you will need

#### Hardware

**Basic buggy**

+ Raspberry Pi 3B, 3B+ or 4
+ Motor controller board (1 minimum)
+ DC motors (2 minimum)
+ Wheels (2 minimum)
+ Ball caster (unless using more than 2 wheels)
+ Ultrasonic distance sensor (between 1-2)
+ Line following sensor (between 2-3)
+ Jumper leads (female-female and male-female) or wire
+ AA battery holder for 4 AA batteries (1 per motor controller board)
+ AA batteries (x4 per motor controller board)
+ A USB battery pack (to power the Raspberry Pi)
+ Soldering iron and solder
+ Wire strippers
+ Scissors
+ Screwdriver
+ Adhesives (duct tape / electrical tape, putty, glue etc.)
+ A small cardboard box for the chassis (can be plastic, wood, metal etc.)

You may also need:

+ Cable ties or velcro straps

**Using a soldering iron can be a bit daunting at first but whether you are new to soldering or a veteran solderer, this [getting started with soldering](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-soldering) resource will provide you with some quick tips and tricks.**

A Raspberry Pi model 3B or above is recommended as you can connect to it over Wifi or Bluetooth without an adapted which will help when programming the buggy.

The ultrasonic distance sensor and line following sensor are required for week 2 and week 3 respectively. 

A ball caster is usually necessary if your buggy has two wheels to balance it and aid with movement.


**Optional extras**

+ Velcro tape
+ Threading tool
+ Screws
+ Tracks or legs
+ USB charge/discharge board (for a motor controller board)
+ PID line following array sensor
+ LEDs

#### Software

+ The latest version of the Raspbian operating system
