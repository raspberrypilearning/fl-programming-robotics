## Welcome to the course

Welcome to *Robotics with Raspberry Pi: Build and Program Your First Robot Buggy*.

Over this course you'll develop a robot buggy and program it. You'll start by making it move about, before programming it to react to sensor readings. By the end of the course you'll be able to make your buggy avoid obstacles and follow a line on the floor.

### What you will learn

Over the next three weeks you will learn about:

+ Using the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi for both input and output
+ How to connect motors via a motorboard and control them using Python
+ Attaching components to a chassis
+ Using an ultrasonic distance sensor (UDS) to detect objects
+ Using inputs to control the outputs of your robot
+ How line sensors work
+ How changing an algorithm can improve the performance of your robot

### What you will need

This course requires you to have the following:

#### Hardware

+ Raspberry Pi 3B, 3B+, or 4
+ Motor controller board
+ Two 3V–6V DC motors
+ Two wheels
+ Ball caster (unless using more than two wheels)
+ Ultrasonic distance sensor (one or two)
+ Two line-following sensors
+ Jumper leads (female-to-female and male-to-female) or wire
+ AA battery holder (for four AA batteries)
+ Four AA batteries
+ A USB powerbank (to power the Raspberry Pi) 
+ Soldering iron and solder
+ Wire strippers
+ Scissors
+ Screwdriver
+ A small cardboard box for the chassis (can be plastic, wood, metal, etc.)

You can view most of the required components on this [AliExpress Wish List](https://my.aliexpress.com/wishlist/shared.htm?groupId=100000018016415), but they can be ordered and bought anywhere, and alternatives are also available.

#### Software

+ The latest version of the Raspbian operating system
+ An IDE of your choice

#### Additional extras

+ Adhesives (duct tape/electrical tape, putty, glue, etc.)
+ Cable ties or Velcro-type straps
+ GPIO reference card

Using a soldering iron can be a bit daunting at first, but whether you are new to soldering or a veteran, this [Getting started with soldering](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-soldering) resource will give you  some quick tips and tricks.

A Raspberry Pi model 3B or above is recommended, as you can connect to it over WiFi or Bluetooth without an adapter; this will help when programming the robot buggy.

The ultrasonic distance sensors and line-following sensors are required for weeks two and three respectively.

A ball caster is necessary if your robot has only two wheels; it will act as a third wheel so that the robot is balanced and can move freely.

### Choosing a programming environment

I recommend using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) during this course to create, run, and test your Python programs.

The IDE I will be using is Mu, which is pre-installed on most Raspberry Pis. Mu is also available at the website [Code with Mu](https://codewith.mu/) along with [instructions on how to install Mu on a Raspberry Pi](https://codewith.mu/en/howto/1.0/install_raspberry_pi).

If you experience problems or would just like to know more about Mu, have a look at Raspberry Pi’s [Getting started with Mu](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-mu) guide.

### Week one

In week one of the course you will attach the motors and get your robot buggy moving.
