## Welcome to the course

Welcome to *Robotics with Raspberry Pi: build and program your first robot buggy*

Over this course you'll develop a robot buggy and program it. You'll start by making it move about, before programming it to react to sensor readings. By the end of the course you'll be able to make your buggy avoid obstacles, or follow a line on the floor.

### What you will learn

Over the next 3 weeks you will learn about:

+ Using the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi for both input and output
+ How to connect motors via a motor board, and control them using Python
+ Attaching components to a chassis
+ Using a ultrasonic distance sensor (UDS) to detect objects
+ Using inputs to control the outputs of your robot
+ How line sensors work
+ How changing an algorithm can improve the performance of your robot

### What you will need

This course requires you to have the following:

#### Hardware

+ Raspberry Pi 3B, 3B+ or 4
+ Motor controller board
+ 2 x 3V - 6V DC motors
+ 2 x wheels
+ Ball caster (unless using more than 2 wheels)
+ Ultrasonic distance sensor (between 1-2)
+ 2 x line following sensors
+ Jumper leads (female-to-female and male-to-female) or wire
+ AA battery holder (for 4 AA batteries)
+ 4 x AA batteries
+ A USB power bank (to power the Raspberry Pi) 
+ Soldering iron and solder
+ Wire strippers
+ Scissors
+ Screwdriver
+ A small cardboard box for the chassis (can be plastic, wood, metal etc.)

You can view most of the required components on this [AliExpress Wish List](https://my.aliexpress.com/wishlist/shared.htm?groupId=100000018016415), but they can be ordered / bought anywhere, and alternatives are also available.

#### Software:

+ The latest version of the Raspbian operating system
+ An IDE of your choice

#### Additional extras:

+ Adhesives (duct tape / electrical tape, putty, glue etc.)
+ Cable ties or velcro straps
+ GPIO reference card

**Using a soldering iron can be a bit daunting at first but whether you are new to soldering or a veteran solderer, this [getting started with soldering](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-soldering) resource will provide you with some quick tips and tricks.**

A Raspberry Pi model 3B or above is recommended as you can connect to it over Wifi or Bluetooth without an adapter - this will help when programming the robot buggy.

The ultrasonic distance sensor and line following sensor are required for week 2 and week 3 respectively.

A ball caster is necessary if your robot has only two wheels to act as a third wheel so the robot is balanced and can move freely.

### Choosing a programming environment

I recommend using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) during this course to create, run and test your Python programs.

The IDE I will be using is **Mu**, which is preinstalled on most Raspberry Pis. Mu is also available at the website [codewith.mu](https://codewith.mu/) along with [Instructions on how to install Mu on a Raspberry Pi](https://codewith.mu/en/howto/1.0/install_raspberry_pi).

If you experience problems or would just like to know more about Mu, have a look at Raspberry Piâ€™s [Getting started with Mu](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-mu) guide.

### Week one

In week one of the course you will attach the motors and get your robot buggy moving!
