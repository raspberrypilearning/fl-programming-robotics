In this step, the different ways that robots can move is discussed

### How to move a robot / how do robots move?

Nearly all robots will have a movable parts which use **actuators** to control the motions, ranging from motorised wheels to an intricate system of adjustable joints. 

Robots can make use of electric motors to provide power to components by converting electrical energy into a mechanical force, such as rotating the propellers of a drone. 



Other types of actuators include pneumatic or hydraulic, which produce a force using pressure from air or liquids respectively to control the movement of components. For example, a hydraulic leg of a robot contains pressurised liquid that can be released by opening a valve which emits a force to extend the piston attached to the leg. The valve would be then be closed again and the pressure aloud to build so this process can be repeated.
