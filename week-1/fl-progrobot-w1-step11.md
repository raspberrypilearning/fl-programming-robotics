## Challenge: driving in patterns

So far, you have been testing that the robot buggy moves appropriately based on the commands `.foward()`, `.backward()`, `.left()`, `.right()` and `.stop()`.

You have also used the `sleep` command to make the program wait for a specified number of seconds before running the next command, thus enabling the buggy to move or stop moving for a certain amount of time.

### Your challenge, should you choose to accept it

The next task is for you to create and test an algorithm that drives the buggy in a certain pattern.

This could be a pattern such as:

+ A square
+ A triangle
+ A star

You could also include a loop in your program so that the buggy repeats the pattern more than once.

Once youâ€™ve completed a challenge, add a comment below and share a link to your code (e.g. using [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/)). You can also comment with any observations you make, and any questions if you are having trouble.
