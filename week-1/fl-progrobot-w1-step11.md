## Challenge: Driving in patterns

So far, you have been testing that the robot buggy moves appropriately in response to the commands `.forward()`, `.backward()`, `.left()`, `.right()`, and `.stop()`. 

You have also used the `sleep()` command to make the program wait for a specified number of seconds before running the next command, thus enabling the buggy to either move or stop moving for a certain amount of time.

### Developing a new algorithm 

The next task is for you to create and test an algorithm that drives the buggy in a certain pattern. 

Start by creating a program that makes your robot drive in the shape of a square.

Then try another pattern, for example:

+ A triangle
+ A star
+ A figure of eight

You could also include a loop in your program so that the buggy repeats a pattern more than once.
