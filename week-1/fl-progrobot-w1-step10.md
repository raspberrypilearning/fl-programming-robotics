### Powering the Raspberry Pi and motor controller

If you are using a mobile battery pack, you can now power up your Raspberry Pi and the motor controller board. If either of the wheels starts spinning continuously, chances are one of the connections to the Raspberry Pi has come loose. Remove the power from the Raspberry Pi and check the wiring from step 1.6.
