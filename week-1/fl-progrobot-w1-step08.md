## Designing the chassis

Now you have the motors set up, the next stage is to design a chassis to house the robot in. A chassis is the physical frame of a wheeled vehicle that holds together the main parts of a vehicle. Your buggy will need a chassis so that you can secure the components, such as the wheels, motors and Raspberry Pi, to it.

### Choosing a material

A chassis for a robot buggy can be built using all sorts of materials; cardboard, plastic or metal to name a few. The material that works best for you depends on the function, cost, and tools available.

When choosing a material, you need to consider aspects such as weight vs durability, cost vs strength, and difficulty to work with vs quality of the chassis. Using certain types of metal might result in a strong and durable chassis but will be more difficult to modify than cardboard. A cardboard chassis will be light and cheap but it is less sturdy than other materials.

I recommend making a prototype of the chassis first using a low-cost material, since tweaking the design will be much easier. Common households items, such as a cardboard box or a plastic ice cream tub, are perfect for experimenting with the design. The robot buggy that is built throughout the videos in this course uses a chassis made out of a cardboard carton which originally contained grapes. The reason I chose this was because it is a good sized box that can hold the robot components without needing to be modified. It is was also easy to make holes in the carton when attaching the components to the chassis.

### Planning the layout

#### What needs to be attached to the chassis

There is no “right” way to build your prototype robot chassis, but there are a few things to bear in mind.

At the very minimum, the chassis needs to house the following components:

+ Raspberry Pi
+ Motor controller board
+ 2 x DC motors
+ Ultrasonic distance sensor
+ 2 x line following sensors
+ AA battery holder (to power the motor controller board)
+ USB battery pack (for powering the Raspberry Pi)

The chassis needs to allow the mounting of a pair of wheels to the axles of the motors, and a ball caster that will act as a third wheel.

#### Making sure the components fit

If you are planning on using a pre-made container for the chassis, you can try placing all the components inside to see if there is room. This will give you an  idea whether the parts will fit or not. Bear in mind that the components can't all be shoved in without much consideration; some parts will need extra space around them so they can be accessed easily, such as the power supply which will need to be recharged. Other parts will need to be secured to certain places on the chassis; for instance the ultrasonic distance sensor must be attached to the front of the chassis so it can sense objects in front of the buggy.

It can also be useful to design the layout of the buggy on paper to make sure that all the components have enough room. Begin by making a footprint, which is the base of your buggy. You need to ensure that all the components can fit inside the footprint appropriately. A good method is to represent each component with a piece of paper that you can easily move about to try out different arrangements.

Make sure each piece of paper is the correct size and shape for the component. You might have to measure your components, but most of them will have technical documentation online that will include their exact dimensions.

### Your turn

Now it is time for you to design a chassis for your robot buggy and make sure all the components fit:

+ Try to find a container that you can use for the prototype of the chassis
+ If you have a container, check that all the components will fit. Otherwise, map out the components on paper
+ Make any modifications to the chassis if necessary or find another container if the design isn't working out
