## Challenge: experimenting with direction and speed

Create a Python file that includes each of the commands: `forward`, `backward`, `left` and `right`. Experiment with giving these commands different values inside the brackets e.g. `robin.left(0.8)`

**Top tip:** if there is a problem with your program or the wiring, the motors can spin continuously. If this happens, try entering the command `robin.stop()` (or the name you gave the robot object followed by `.stop()`) into the Python shell. Otherwise, turn off the battery pack or Raspberry Pi and check the wiring is correct.

**Top tip:** create different versions of your code once you have made something work. This way, if you add or change the functionality of the buggy and accidentally break the program you still have working code to use and compare with.

### Discussion

+ What happens when you change the value inside the brackets of the direction commands? 
+ What happens when you use a value over 1 or less than 0.2?
