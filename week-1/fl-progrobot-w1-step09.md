## Attaching the components to the chassis

Once you have ensured all the robot parts fit to the chassis, you need to secure some of the components in place.

### Permanent and removable fastenings

Some types of fastening might be preferable to others depending on the material of the robot chassis and the component being secured.

Whilst making the prototype chassis, you may not want to use permanent fastenings, such as adhesive putty or glue, if you intend on removing the components at a later stage. In this instance, a fastening that is easier to remove may be better, for example tape, cable ties or velcro strips. Once you are confident that you will not have to take things apart, using a permanent fastening might be desirable to keep a component secured firmly in place.

Screw holes may need to be incorporated into the chassis to attach some components, the ball caster for example. If you are using a material that is fairly durable, like metal or a hard plastic, you can use a threading tool to create threads for the screws. Otherwise, you can use a sharp instrument to make a small hole for the screw to go through.

### Securing the components in place

I'm going to be using a cardboard box as my chassis. If you are using a different type of material or container for your chassis then some of these instructions may need to be adjusted to suit your design.

**1.** The first step is to place your motors into the chassis.

Place your motors inside the box, in roughly the position that you would like them to sit. Then use a pen to mark the place where the motors’ axle will need to pass through the walls of the box. Make sure you are giving your wheels enough room to spin around.

**2.** Make a hole that is big enough for the motors’ axles to fit through.

If your chassis is made out of cardboard, use a sharp object such as a pencil or screwdriver to carefully poke holes through the sides of the box.

**3.** You will need to fix the motors in place, otherwise they will move once the wheels are attached and the motors are powered.

Use a permanent or removable fastening to hold the motors down. If this is your prototype, tape or cable ties might be best as these will be easy to remove.

**4.** Once the motors are in place, you can attach the wheels to the axles.

**5.** When the wheels are in place, you can screw a ball caster to the front of the container to act as a third wheel.

**6.** If you haven't done so already, place the motor controller, Raspberry Pi, and battery packs for the motor board and Pi inside the chassis.

You won't need to secure these components to the chassis just yet. Remember you will need to access the Raspberry Pi and parts of the chassis later in the course to add the ultrasonic distance sensor and line following sensor.

Make sure there is nothing that could disturb the jumper leads that are connected to the Raspberry Pi as they can easily come loose.
