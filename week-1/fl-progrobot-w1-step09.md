## Designing the chassis

Now you have the motors set up, the next stage is to design a chassis to house the robot in. The chassis is the base frame of a wheeled vehicle on which the wheels and body of the vehicle is mounted. 

### Choosing a material

The materials used and size of your chassis requires considered choices. A chassis for a robot buggy can be built using all sorts of materials such as cardboard, plastic or metal to name a few. 

The material that works best for you depends on function, cost, and the tools available. For example, using certain types of plastic might provide a lightweight and secure chassis for the buggy. However, the plastic may need to be drilled through so that the wheels can be attached to the motors. This will require the correct drill bits otherwise the plastic could crack.

I recommend on using a low-cost material, especially when building the robot buggy in the first instance, as tweaking the design will be much easier. The robot buggy that is built throughout the videos for this course is contained in a cardboard chassis that was originally a container for grapes - tasty!

### Planning the layout

#### What needs to be attached to the chassis

At the very minimum, the chassis will need to house the following components:

+ Raspberry Pi
+ Motor controller board
+ DC motors (2 x minimum)
+ Ultrasonic distance sensor (1 x minimum)
+ Line following sensor (1 x minimum)
+ AA battery holder (to power the motor controller board)
+ USB battery pack (for powering the Raspberry Pi)

#### Making sure the components fit

If you are planning on using a pre-made container for the chassis, such as a cardboard box or plastic ice cream tub, you can try placing all the components inside to see if there is room. This will give you a rough idea whether the components will fit or not.

It can also be useful to design the layout of the buggy on paper to make sure that all the components have enough room. Begin by making a footprint, which is the base of your buggy. You need to ensure that all the components can fit inside the footprint. A good method is to represent each component with a piece of paper that you can easily move about to try out different arrangements. 

Make sure each piece of paper is the correct size and shape for the component. You might have to measure your components, but most of them will have technical documentation online that will include their exact dimensions. Bear in mind that some of the components will need extra space around them so they can be accessed easily. For instance, the power supply for the Raspberry Pi will need to be accessible so it can be charged, as will the AA battery pack for the motor board in case the batteries need replacing.
