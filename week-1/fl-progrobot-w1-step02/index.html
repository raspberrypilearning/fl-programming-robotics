<p>Before you begin your course, we would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to the team here at the Raspberry Pi Foundation.</p>
<p>We are a charity that works to put the power of computing and digital making into the hands of people all over the world. We do this so that more people are able to harness the power of digital technologies for work, to solve problems that matter to them, and to express themselves creatively.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things we currently offer to educators:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computing clubs <a href="https://codeclub.org/">in your school</a> or <a href="https://coderdojo.com">local community centre</a></li>
<li>Educational events for <a href="https://coolestprojects.org/">students</a> and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/training/picademy/">teachers</a></li>
<li>High-quality, peer-reviewed resources written by experienced teachers</li>
<li>Fun and engaging computing tutorials on our <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/">projects site</a></li>
<li>Online training courses like this one </li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="Sue Sentance: Chief learning officer" src="https://rpf-futurelearn.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/all+courses+/Sue+Sentence+-+cropped.png" /></p>
<p>"The team here at Raspberry Pi feel passionately that everybody should have access to a high-quality computing education. These courses, part of the NCCE, and all the other offerings from Raspberry Pi, are built to equip you with the skills and knowledge you need to succeed. Whether you are an educator looking to improve your subject knowledge, a hobbyist who is interested in the subject matter, or even a student yourself, we hope you enjoy learning with us. We are here to support you, so let us know what you like and how we could do better in the comments or through the feedback forms provided."</p>
<h3 id="meet-your-course-facilitators">Meet your course facilitators</h3>
<p>Our team is made up of both former and current teachers of computing, with loads of classroom experience. </p>
<p><strong>Alex Parry</strong> is a Learning Manager at the Raspberry Pi Foundation and Computer Science teacher. When not coding, he enjoys table tennis, gaming and going for walks in the woods.</p>
<p><img alt="Alex Parry" src="https://rpf-futurelearn.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Robotics+-+Robot+Buggy/Photographs/Alex+Parry+-+cropped.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Nina Syzmor</strong> is a Translation Community Manager at Raspberry Pi. She's a former translator herself, and used to teach languages and translation at a university. She's keen on breaking down language barriers in computing education. In her free time, she likes to drink coffee, eat cake, and do crafty things.</p>
<p><img alt="Nina Syzmor" src="https://rpf-futurelearn.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Robotics+-+Robot+Buggy/Photographs/Nina+Syzmor+-+cropped.jpg" /></p>
<p>We care about supporting teachers to achieve their goals, and so we've made it <em>our</em> goal to provide you with the best digital learning experience possible &mdash; for free. That means being available to answer questions and give you feedback throughout the course. </p>
<p>Check out our facilitation team's introductions in the comments section below. </p>
<h3 id="introduce-yourself">Introduce yourself</h3>
<p>The best way to learn is by collaborating with other amazing people.</p>
<p>With this in mind, please introduce yourself to your fellow learners by commenting at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Think about answering these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What made you take the course?</li>
<li>What are you hoping to learn?</li>
<li>What steps will you take to ensure that you will complete the course, for example by setting aside some 'do not disturb' time in your schedule each week, or by inviting a colleague to take it with you?</li>
</ul>
<p>Together we will build a community of educators who share ideas and inspire each other to learn along the way.</p>
