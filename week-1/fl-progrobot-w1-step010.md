## Attaching the components to the chassis

Once you have ensured all the robot parts fit to the chassis, you need to secure the components.

### Permanent and removable fastenings



### Securing the components in place 



The first step is to place your motors into the chassis.

Place your motors inside the box, in roughly the position that you would like them to sit. Then use a pen to mark the place where the motorsâ€™ axle will need to pass through the walls of the box. Make sure you are giving your wheels enough room to spin around.
