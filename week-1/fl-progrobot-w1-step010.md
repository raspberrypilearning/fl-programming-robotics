## Attaching the components to the chassis

Once you have ensured all the robot parts fit to the chassis, you need to secure the components.

### Permanent and removable fastenings



Use an adhesive putty or tape to hold them down.

### Securing the components in place 

I'm going to be using a cardboard box as my chassis. If you are using a different type of material or container for your chassis then some of these instructions may need to be adjusted to suit your design.

**1.** The first step is to place your motors into the chassis.

Place your motors inside the box, in roughly the position that you would like them to sit. Then use a pen to mark the place where the motors’ axle will need to pass through the walls of the box. Make sure you are giving your wheels enough room to spin around.

**2.** Make a hole that is big enough for the motors’ axels to fit through. 

If your chassis is made out of cardboard, use a sharp object such as a pencil or screwdriver to carefully poke holes through the sides of the box.

**3.** You will need to fix the motors in place, otherwise they will move once the wheels are attached and the motors are powered. 

Use a permanent or removable fastening to hold the motors down. If this is your prototype, tape or cable ties might be best as these will be easy to remove.

**4.** Once the motors are in place, you can attach the wheels to the axles.

**5.** When the wheels are in place, you can screw a ball caster to the front of the container to act as a third wheel.

**6.** If you’re using a power bank, you can now power up your Raspberry Pi.
