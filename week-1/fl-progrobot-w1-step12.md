## Why we call Robotics challenging.

You are coming to the end of the first week of robotics experience, and you may have noticed that working in this discipline requires you to navigate some challenges. Robotics is such a complex and vast subject which can be off putting when you are just starting off. I want to discuss some of these challenges and how you have overcome them. We are all in this together after all.

### The components

**Jumper Cables** 

The jumper cables you have been using for the buggy so far, have a tendency to come loose from the components or GPIO pins if you knock them. I cannot tell you how many times I have been pulling my hair out trying to find an error in my code only to find a loose jumper cable that is causing my problem.

**GPIO pin numbers are weird** 

The numbering on the GPIO pins can be confusing, they are numbered as the processor sees the, not as they are laid out on the board. This is a product of wanting the Raspberry Pi to be backwards compatible as much as possible, when the pins changed from a 26 pin to a 40 pin set up they had to be rearranged and the original pins were moved and mixed with new ones 

**Debugging components** 

A lot of the things you have done this week will be completely new to you, especially the components you are using may be unfamiliar to you. When you deal with components rather than products you forgo some of the hand holding that comes with a pre-built device.

When you buy components you have to figure out how they work and test them. When the components are new to you, this can be a challenging process - as you don't know what to look for or how to test the component. 

**Cardboard is easy - not strong** 

As you create your buggy, you are most likely using cardboard to house it. Which is great, and the most sensible option for the initial build. This however brings it's own challenges - as previously mentioned the components are susceptible to being knocked out of place. These two challenges combine meaning that as roboticists we need to do 2 things when testing; checking the components after each run and make sure to avoid bumps as much as possible.

### The environment

**Not all floors are made equally** 

When you create a mobile robot, particularly one that uses wheels to navigate around - you will quickly realise you have to choose the floor you test it on.

Some motors have no problem navigating carpet, linoleum or tiles - others will not work on anything less than smooth concrete. This can cause frustration as you adjust the settings on the wheels - only to find out it was an uneven floor causing the issues.

**Environment's are not consistent** 

Some of the sensors and components you will use can be greatly impacted by the environment you test the buggy in. Light and line sensors can be thrown off by environmental light levels and have to be calibrated in order to be accurate. A simple thing to do, if you are comfortable with the components. 

### It's not you, it's robotics

I hope you have found some comfort in this step, this is a challenging area of computing - and you are not alone in finding frustrations when working on your buggy. 

**Think of a challenge you have had to navigate during this first week.**

**It could be one from the areas I have discussed - or another challenge you would like to discuss** 

**What happened? How did you overcome the challenge? If you haven't this is a great time to ask for help** 

**If you haven't experienced these challenges, what have you done to prevent them? Could you share your process to help other learners?**
