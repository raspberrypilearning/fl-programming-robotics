## Peer-assessment: Create a new function for your robot buggy

This course has been all about building and programming a robot buggy using a Raspberry Pi. Over the three weeks of the course you have been following my instructions, attaching components to your chassis, and writing code to communicate with these components.

Now it's time for you to create a new piece of functionality for your robot on your own. You'll then share what you've done with a fellow learner, so that they can give you feedback on it.

Some examples of modifications you could make to your robot are:

+ [Allowing the buggy to be controlled remotely](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/remote-control-buggy)
+ Adding a second UDS to the front of your chassis to improve object detection
+ Attaching LEDs to your robot and decorating the chassis
+ Replacing the ball caster with two more wheels
+ [Using a PID controller](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/robotPID) to gain more precise control over your robot's movement

Alongside this, write a short summary of your new function, including:

+ The original idea and why you chose it
+ The components you used and any modifications you had to make to your robot
+ A copy of your code and a description of how you designed and tested your program
+ The challenges you had while adding the new functionality, as well as the successes you are proud of

### Guidelines

Make sure that your assignment meets the following criteria as well as possible. You should:

+ Add a new piece of functionality to your robot
+ Thoroughly document the components you used and the code you developed
+ Demonstrate how you tested your robot

### Submitting your assignment

**In the comments section, share a link to the document that you have written describing the new functionality you've added to your robot. Either include the photos or video of your robot in that document, or as separate links in your comment.**

You could use any cloud-based storage or office solution, such as:

- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/basic)
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
- [Microsoft OneDrive/](https://onedrive.live.com)

Remember that you also need to include links to the photos or videos of your robot that I've asked you to include. To do this you may want to use a service like [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).

### Reviewing your peers' work

Once you've completed your assignment and shared it, I'd like you to take a look at several of the assignments submitted by your fellow learners. Pick at least one other assignment to review, and **respond to the comment containing the link to the assignment with a review of that assignment**. Reviews should mention:

1. Something that you liked about the new functionality of the robot
2. How the documentation met or failed to meet the **guidelines** set out above

Writing well-considered feedback will not only help the author of that assignment, but will also help you to reflect on your own work too.

### Improving your robot

If you come across anything in another assignment that inspires you to add to or change the functionality of your robot further, feel free to update your robot. Make sure to thank the learner who has inspired the change.

### Your actions

**For this step, you need to:**

1. **Add functionality to your robot**
2. **Document the new functionality you've added**
3. **Share the documentation, with photos and/or video**
4. **Examine several other assignments that have been shared**
5. **Review at least one other assignment**
6. ***(Optional) Use what you have learnt to further develop your own robot***
