## Peer-assessment: Create a new function for your robot buggy

This course has been all about building and programming a robot buggy using a Raspberry Pi. Over the three weeks of the course you have been following my instructions, attaching components to your chassis, and writing code to communicate with these components.

Now it's time for you to create a new piece of functionality for your robot on your own. You'll then share what you've done with a fellow learner, so that they can give you feedback on it.

Some examples of modifications you could make to your robot are:

+ Allowing the buggy to be controlled [remotely](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/remote-control-buggy)
+ Adding a second UDS to the front of your chassis to improve object detection
+ Attaching LEDs to your robot and decorating the chassis
+ Replacing the ball caster with two more wheels
+ Using a [PID controller](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/robotPID) to gain more precise control over your robot's movement

For this assignment you should upload images of your upgraded robot to an image-hosting platform such as [Imgur](https://www.imgur.com/) or a video-hosting platform such as [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) and include the link in your assignment.

Alongside this, write a short summary of your new function, including:

+ The original idea and why you chose it
+ The components you used and any modifications you had to make to your robot
+ A copy of your code and a description of how you designed and tested your program
+ The challenges you had while adding the new functionality, as well as the successes you are proud of

This assignment is peer assessed: once you have submitted your assignment, it will be reviewed by another learner on the course. In turn, you will be asked to assess another learnerâ€™s work.

There is a free-form text box for you to use below, but please feel free to include links to any online content you produce. You could use any cloud-based storage or office solution, such as:

* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com)
* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)

Remember that you also need to include links to the photos or videos of your robot that I've asked you to include.

**Warning:** Once you submit your assignment, you cannot edit it again. It will be sent to another learner for feedback. Please be sure to read over your submission carefully before you send it off.

### Assignment guidelines

You must give three assignment guidelines in the form of questions for the peer reviewer to answer, for example:

+ What new piece of functionality has the author added?
+ How well have they documented the components used and the code developed?
+ How thoroughly has the author tested their robot?
