## Building awesome robots

Now that you've had the chance to look at the robots that your peers have produced, it's time to think about building hobby robots in general.

Try to think about what elements of a robot that made you prefer some robots to others. It could be a piece of functionality that you hadn't considered before, or a design choice that you particularly admired.

- Did any of them give you inspirationg for a future robotics project?
- Do you think that the design of any of the robots might be particularly attractive for a particular person or group of people you know, for example a friend or the students you teach?
- Have you learnt how to avoid a potential problem by looking at any of these robots.
