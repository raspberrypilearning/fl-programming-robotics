It’s important to take some time out to reflect on what you’ve learnt so far. 

People who take time to reflect on their learning are much more likely to make use of it later. And you will help us make our courses even better by sharing your reflections with us. With that in mind, we’d like you to fill in our [Reflection Form](https://form.raspberrypi.org/f/fl_confidence_survey_non_programming?tfa_262=robot-6). 

It will help you connect the dots between all the new knowledge you’ve taken in, and get your synapses firing to find new ways to apply your learning.

*All the information collected is anonymous, and will be stored and handled according to Form Assembly's privacy policy/terms and conditions. It will be used by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and the National Centre for Computing Education to help evaluate our courses. Your participation has no effect on your course progress, marks, or FutureLearn profile.*
