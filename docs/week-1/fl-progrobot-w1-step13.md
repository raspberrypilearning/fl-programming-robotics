## The end of week one

Congratulations on reaching the end of week one! If you still haven't managed to get your robot moving, ask for help in the comments below. Well done if you have managed to complete all of the tasks this week and programmed your robot to drive in a particular pattern.

### Key points

+ You learnt about the Raspberry Pi, and how the GPIO pins make it a good platform to use for building a robot
+ Motors require more power than a Raspberry Pi can provide, as well as analogue signals, so you connected your motors via a motorboard
+ You designed a chassis and connected your motors to it, making sure that you knew which way around they were connected
+ Finally, you used the `Robot` class to control your motors, and make your robot drive around

Next week you'll move on to taking inputs from sensors, and use those to affect how your robot moves.

Is there anything this week which particularly challenged you? What accomplishment do you feel most proud of? Let us know in the comments!
