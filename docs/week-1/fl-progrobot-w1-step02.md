## Meet the team and your fellow learners

Before you begin your course, we would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to the team here at the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://raspberrypi.org).

We are a charity that works to put the power of computing and digital making into the hands of people all over the world. We do this so that more people are able to harness the power of digital technologies for work, to solve problems that matter to them, and to express themselves creatively.

Here are some of the things we currently offer:

+ More [online training courses](https://www.futurelearn.com/partners/raspberry-pi) like this one
+ The [Teach Computing Curriculum](https://teachcomputing.org/curriculum), hundreds of hours of high-quality, peer-reviewed lesson resources written by experienced teachers
[Isaac Computer Science](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/) is a free learning platform for computer science students and teachers.
+ Support for running [Code Clubs in schools](https://codeclub.org/) and [CoderDojo computing clubs in your community](https://coderdojo.com).
+ Competitions to inspire young people in computing, such as [Coolest Projects](https://coolestprojects.org), a technology showcase for young people, and [Astro Pi](https://astro-pi.org/) - giving young people the opportunity to get their code to run on the International Space Station
[Fun and engaging computing tutorials](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/)

### Meet your course team

Our team is made up of both former and current computing educators who have used their experience to create these courses.

Our lead educators for this course are [Alex Parry](https://www.futurelearn.com/profiles/9698392) and Nina Syzmor.

**Alex Parry** is a Learning Manager at the Raspberry Pi Foundation and Computer Science teacher. When not coding, he enjoys table tennis, gaming and going for walks in the woods.

**Nina Syzmor** is a Translation Community Manager at Raspberry Pi. She's a former translator herself, and used to teach languages and translation at a university. She's keen on breaking down language barriers in computing education. In her free time, she likes to drink coffee, eat cake, and do crafty things.

We care about supporting teachers to achieve their goals, and so we've made it *our* goal to provide you with the best digital learning experience possible â€” for free. That means being available to answer questions and give you feedback throughout the course. 

### Introduce yourself

The best way to learn is by collaborating with other amazing people.

With this in mind, please introduce yourself to your fellow learners by commenting at the bottom of the page.

Think about answering these questions:

+ What made you take the course?
+ What are you hoping to learn?
+ What steps will you take to ensure that you will complete the course, for example by setting aside some 'do not disturb' time in your schedule each week, or by inviting a colleague to take it with you?

You can also reply to your fellow learners in the comments section. Together we will build a community of educators who share ideas and inspire each other to learn along the way.
