## How could you improve the functionality of the buggy?

Now that you have created a buggy that can move in various directions, have a think about what improvements you could make.

For example, what components could you add to your robot buggy to make it sense the world around it? How should your buggy act, based on this new information? What algorithms could you use to make it behave differently?  

This is also a great time to share your progress and any pictures or videos that you have of your robot in action. Describe your progress, and share a link to any images or videos you've taken of your robot, in the comments section below. You may need to use an image-hosting platform such as [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), or a video-hosting platform such as [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com).

In the next step you will find out about a range of sensors and learn how robots can use these to understand their environment.
