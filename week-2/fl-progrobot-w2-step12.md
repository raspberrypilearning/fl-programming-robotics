## The end of week two

Well done on reaching the end of week two of the course. This week, you've attached a UDS sensor to your robot and coded the robot to avoid obstacles. You've also thought about how your robot should react to obstacles, and considered its limitations.

Next week, you will build on your learning by adding more sensors to your buggy, and write a line-following algorithm.

What did you enjoy most this week? Did you find anything particularly tricky? Share your thoughts in the comments section.
