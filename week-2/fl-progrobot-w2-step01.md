## Welcome to week two

Welcome to week two of *Robotics with Raspberry Pi: Build and program your first robot buggy*. Last week, you started building your robot, with wheels and a chassis. You also programmed it in Python, to make it move.

This week, you will:

+ Discover different types of sensors that robots can use
+ Look in more detail at how a distance sensor works
+ Attach an ultrasonic distance sensor (UDS) to your buggy
+ Program your robot to avoid obstacles detected by the UDS

I hope you enjoy the week!
